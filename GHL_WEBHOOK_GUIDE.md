# GoHighLevel Webhook Integration Guide

## Webhook URL
```
https://tmmb-discord-bot-production.up.railway.app/webhook/gohighlevel
```

---

## How It Works

1. **GHL sends webhook** at 7, 30, or 90 days after Discord access
2. **Webhook includes count parameter** (7, 30, or 90)
3. **Bot sends DM immediately** with the appropriate message
4. **No scheduling needed** - GHL handles the timing!
